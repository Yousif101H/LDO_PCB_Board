# LDO_Board
This is a simple LDO PCB board to convert power from +5V to +3.3V where I use the following:
1. LDO: MIC5317 (Datasheet link: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/MIC5317_High_Performance_Single_150mA_LDO_DS200061-1891237.pdf)
2. Two ceramic caps as decoupling capacitors (0805, 10uF, X7R, 15%, 10%, 10V)
3. Two JST GH connectors for input and output volatge
